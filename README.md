## Plugins

#### Axis Unlocker [KK/KKS]
Makes the manipulation axis speed and size sliders' minimum and maximum values configurable.
Optionally converts the sliders to logarithmic base.

#### Expression Control [KK/KKS]
This is an old plugin which I decompiled and modified to also be able to be used on males.

#### KKUSS Fix [KKS]
Fixes the KKUSS shaders when used in Koikatsu Sunshine by making sure they always have at least a flat normal map.
Can be extended for other shaders having the same problem, hit me up if you find any.

#### Light Toggler [KK/KKS]
Automatically toggles on/off lights when a parent folder or object is toggled on/off.
Also works for items that have built-in lights.
The changes persist through saves/loads without adding extended data to the scene.

#### Mass Shader Editor [KK/KKS]
A plugin that lets you edit the properties of multiple shaders at once, based on item selection.
For both Maker and Studio. Also lets you swap shaders for others.
Contains a built-in tutorial and help section due to its many options.
